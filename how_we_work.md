# How We Work: Roles, Goals, and Expectations

## Introduction

The Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology (LMP) and the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI) have formed a dedicated partnership to advance bioinformatics research and clinical diagnostics using NGS. This collaboration is focused around working on discrete "projects," broadly defined in two main categories.

1. Research: Supporting bioinformatics-based research projects initiated by LMP Principal Investigators (PIs).
2. Clinical: Developing and maintaining CLIA-validated and CAP-certified pipelines for somatic and germline variant testing.

Our LMP bioinformatics team includes five analysts working within MSI’s Research Informatics (RI) – Bioinformatics section, which comprises of approximately 20 analysts in total. This document outlines how we work: our roles, project goals, values, and expectations when partnering with collaborators. It builds on elements of the MSI/LMP Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and provides practical guidance for day-to-day collaboration.

## Roles

### The Principal Investigator (PI)

- Defines the research question and overall goals
- Provides experimental context and input on results
- Supplies funding or support for analyst time (or support from the LMP Department)
- Is responsible for scientific integrity and directs the publication process

### The PI's Research Team

- May include postdocs, graduate students, or lab scientists
- Engages with analysts on project-specific details
- Helps with data interpretation and generating follow-up questions
- Supplies important metadata, wet-bench manuals/methods
- **Manages communication with other collaborators** (e.g. UMGC)
- Is responsible for generating final "publication ready" figures

### The Bioinformatics Analyst

- Advises on experimental design and feasibility (communicates the plan and adapts based on PI feedback)
- Architects and executes the code for the analysis. However, we generally use a structure optimized for reproducibility:
  - input files (provided to us, or generated without code)
  - source code
  - output files generated by code only
  - metadata (any other related files not used directly as inputs)
- Communicates findings and next steps via weekly meetings
  - This may include walking through output files via file browser
  - A presentation (i.e. PPTX) may be effective in rough-draft format (but we want to communicate exploratory results quickly and limit extra work)
  - Markdown or AI summaries could also be helpful communicating dynamic updates
  - Email summaries (bullet points) are also sufficient
- Communication timing may be non-linear, but when important feedback is needed, we connect as soon as possible
- All project code will be synced with GitHub.umn.edu
- Writes a custom methods section for any results included in publications
  - Writing a separate methods section for all analysis is not generally useful
  - These summaries become out of date (incorrect) quickly
  - We will rely on our code to be the correct source for analysis methods
- Ensures data continuity, backups, and reproducibility
  - Raw data (e.g. FASTQs) are backed up into PI-owned MSI Tier 2 buckets
  - Project results may are backed up (at some point) to PI-owned MSI Tier 2 buckets
  - The location of these backups will be included in the project README file
- Maintains professional and collaborative communication
- Generates timely results and communicates roadblocks as soon as possible

### The Informatics Team

- Includes the LMP bioinformatics manager, other analysts, and core staff (e.g., UMGC contacts)
- Offers technical guidance and relates previous experience to the primary analyst at weekly group meetings (or whenever possible)
- The LMP bioinformatics manager is responsible for assigning an analyst to a project based on timing and best fit

## What We Provide

- Customized expert analysis using the most appropriate tools and methods
  - This may require building our own tools
  - It may require using stable (older) tools
  - It may require using cutting-edge untested methods
- Experimental design consultation
- Comprehensive and reproducible workflows
- Reports
  - Comprehensive reports may be needed for certain activities (documentation of a clinical pipeline)
  - In other cases, simplified summaries via email, Google Doc, or README files will be sufficient
  - We aim to balance time spent documenting results vs writing clear and concise code that can be reviewed by anyone
- Grant and manuscript support
- Data management and continuity between analysts
- Reviewing wet lab procedures (e.g. sequencing library specifics) and integrating these features into the analysis
- Best practices in method selection and documentation
- Responsiveness and adaptability to project needs

## Project Lifecycle

### Project Initiation

Projects typically begin when a PI reaches out to discuss a research or clinical question. We meet to review:

- Experimental design
- Project scope and objectives
- Timelines
- Roles and responsibilities

### Assignment and Time Allocation

An analyst is assigned to the project based on availability, interest, and experience or best fit. Assignments are typically planned in monthly increments, with regular reviews of progress and needs. Time may be extended depending on funding and project complexity. Funding may come from the LMP department or from PI-supported grants as a percent effort.

### Communication and Milestones

We maintain regular communication through meetings, email, and shared documentation. Analysts provide updates on progress, request clarification when needed, and document all methods and code. Deliverables are shared in stages, with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and feedback.

## Expectations and Responsibilities

- Use of high-performance computing (HPC) and core infrastructure
- All code synced with GitHub.umn.edu
- All results will be accessible on MSI storage (during or soon after a project is completed)
- Our interactions are collaborative, not focused on training others (we support projects, but not hands-on training of collaborators or their teams)
- Clear and timely communication
- Shared understanding of goals and timelines
- Transparency in methods and reproducibility
- Commitment to robust, scalable, and interpretable analysis

## Our Values

- **Clarity:** Code, reports, and decisions should be understandable now and in the future (especially by our future selves)
- **Collaboration:** We work _with_ teams, not _for_ them.
- **Integrity:** We admit mistakes quickly and operate within our areas of expertise.
- **Trust:** We maintain consistent, professional communication and follow through on commitments.
- **Innovation:** We stay current with bioinformatics and wet lab methods.
- **Respect:** Everyone brings expertise—scientific, clinical, or technical, regardless of their role or status and will listen consider multiple perspectives.
- **Creativity and Autonomy:** Analysts have room to explore better approaches and suggest new ideas.
- **Feedback:** We encourage feedback from our collaborators and coworkers, and are empowered to share feedback with them.

## Conclusion

This document sets a foundation for collaboration and helps clarify how the LMP bioinformatics team contributes to research success. By aligning our goals with shared expectations and values, we hope to deliver rigorous, timely, and impactful work across all our projects.
