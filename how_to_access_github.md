# How to set up GitHub.com for use with UMN Organizations

All of our code is synced with [GitHub.com](GitHub.com) via a UMN-owned [GitHub Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations). You'll need to follow the steps below to obtain access,  [GitHub Teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams) 

## You will need a GitHub.com account

- You can use any account.
- You should choose an account (username) that you are comfortable sharing with your coworkers. 
- If you do not want to reveal your personal GitHub account to coworkers, create a new (professional) account for your UMN activities.
- Create this account using any email address (i.e. your personal Gmail/Yahoo/Outlook or UMN email address)

## Add your UMN email address to GitHub.com

- Go to [https://github.com/settings/emails](https://github.com/settings/emails)
- Make sure your UMN email address is one of your "verified" email addresses
- The UMN email address does not need to be the primary address on the account

## Get added to a UMN GitHub Organization

- We manage two GitHub orgs, owned by UMN OIT:
    - [https://github.com/umn-msi-mdl](https://github.com/umn-msi-mdl) for Fairview MDL clinical projects
    - [https://github.com/umn-msi-lmnp](https://github.com/umn-msi-lmnp) for all other Lab Med and Path related projects
- If you need access to repos in either of these accounts:
    - Email Todd Knutson and request access: [knut0297@umn.edu](mailto:knut0297@umn.edu)
    - Todd will invite you to join the org
    - Check your UMN email account and "accept" the invite to the org
    - You should be able to access to the organization.
        - You will be added to a GitHub Team (usually PI-based teams) and that team will be given access to the repo of interest
        - After you are member of the org, any of the MSI analysts can give you access to certain repos via GitHub teams
    - Please email Todd if you have any questions!
